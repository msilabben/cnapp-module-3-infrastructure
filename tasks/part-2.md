# Part 2: Scan the environment

Your infrastructure has just been built successfully. But that does not mean it is without flaws.
The `.github/workflows/iac-scan.yml` file includes scanning tools to check for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations that might be exploitable in created branches.


## Task 1: Add flaws to a branch

Create a new branch in your fork.

Change the following lines in `/environments/dev/main.tf`:

```
resource "azurerm_role_assignment" "aks_new_acr_pull" {
  scope                = module.container_registry.id
  role_definition_name = "AcrPull"
  principal_id         = module.aks_cluster.kubelet_identity_object_id
}

resource "azurerm_role_assignment" "deployment_acr_push" {
  scope                = module.container_registry.id
  role_definition_name = "AcrPush"
  principal_id         = module.federated_id_for_deployment.github_actions_push_principal_id
  principal_type       = "ServicePrincipal"
}
```
to

```
resource "azurerm_role_assignment" "aks_new_acr_pull" {
  scope                = module.container_registry.id
  role_definition_name = "Owner"
  principal_id         = module.aks_cluster.kubelet_identity_object_id
}

resource "azurerm_role_assignment" "deployment_acr_push" {
  scope                = module.container_registry.id
  role_definition_name = "Owner"
  principal_id         = module.federated_id_for_deployment.github_actions_push_principal_id
  principal_type       = "ServicePrincipal"
}
```

Commit your changes and push to your fork.
Go to your created pull requests in GitHub and then "Checks". Try to answer the following questions:

- Can you find the code scanning results for both Trivy and Checkov?
- How many flaws did both tools identity?
- Do you see the change to Owner flaw somewhere?

## Task 2
We have multiple tasks at this point. You are free to choose which to do and in which order.

### Task a: Fix flaws in your infrastructure

Select some of the flaws identified in the previous step and see if you can fix them using terraform.

### Task b: Add a policy

In `iac-scan.yml` remove the following line:

    `if: false # Remove this to enable Policy as Code (PaC) with Open Policy Agent`
This will enable OPA, a policy enforcer for your branches.
There is currently one policy for Trivy written in rego at `policy/trivy.rego`.
Can you create a new policy for either Checkkov or Trivy to warn for the Owner role previously introduced?
